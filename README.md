# SQL Database Analysis
In this analysis, I developed SQL queries for the Chinook Database, which contains information about a digital music store. The goal was to assist the Chinook team in better understanding their media inventory, customers, employees, and invoice data.

I used SQLite to create a series of queries exploring various aspects of the database. Additionally, I generated charts and visualizations using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint to present the findings clearly.

Analysis Overview
The Chinook Database simulates a digital music store environment. This analysis involved writing SQL queries to extract insights on:

Media inventory (albums, tracks, genres)

Customer demographics and purchasing behavior

Employee roles and sales performance

Invoice and payment data analysis

Technologies Used
SQLite (for querying the Chinook Database)

Microsoft Excel (for data visualization)

Microsoft PowerPoint (for presenting charts and summaries)

How to Run the Queries
Download the Chinook Database file (Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite or similar).

Open the database with an SQLite client (such as DB Browser for SQLite).

Open the SQL query files included in this repository.

Execute the queries to see results.

Use the outputs to generate charts or reports as needed.

Sample Queries
Here are examples of the types of queries written:

Retrieve total sales by customer

List top-selling tracks and albums

Analyze sales performance by employee

Explore invoice totals over time

Visualizations
Visual representations of the query results were created in Microsoft Excel and compiled into PowerPoint slides to illustrate trends and key findings.
